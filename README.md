# 🏦 Loan Eligibility Approval System

A Machine Learning-powered web application designed to automate and streamline the loan eligibility prediction process for financial institutions. This project is developed as part of my MCA Final Year Project.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Loan Eligibility Approval System** uses machine learning algorithms to assess whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan based on key input parameters such as income, employment status, credit history, and more.

The application features:
- A clean, responsive user interface
- A trained ML model for predicting eligibility
- Integration with backend (Flask/PHP, depending on your tech stack)
- MySQL database for storing user/application data

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (choose based on your version)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Machine Learning**: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, etc.)
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, XAMPP (for PHP projects), Jupyter Notebook

## 🛠 Features

- 🧾 User input form for loan details
- 🧠 ML model predicts loan eligibility
- 💾 MySQL integration to store applicants
- 📊 Dashboard to view application history (optional)
- 🔒 Basic validation and error handling
